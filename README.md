# SP23-CS554AH1-Konda

# This project was developed using the visual studio coding IDE.
# In Week 3, a single program was created, a runnable process was instantiated, the doWork() method was called, and the class RunnableProcess     was inherited.
# Week 4: Implemented FCFS Policy; week_4.Java execution
# In week_5.java, we added a number of RunnableProcess objects to the ProcessQueue and introduced a method for a RunnableProcess to tell the       Scheduler class when it has done running. We also built a random point for a process to "sleep" inside a RunnableProcess.
# Process and Scedular classes were separately created in Week 6 along with classes for FCFS and Round Robin.Run RoundRobinExample.java for       RoundRobin and FCFSExample.java for FCFS.
# Examinaiton Findings:
# FCFS Average Wait Time: 8.33
# Round Robin average wait time: 7.0
